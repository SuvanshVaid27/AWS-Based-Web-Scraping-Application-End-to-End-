# AWS-Based-Web-Scraping-Application-End-to-End


This project is a complete AWS based solution with the aim of scraping news article headlines from a website, storing them in a database and analyszing the results. 

SQL, Python, AWS Cloud and shell scripting were used to create this data solution. The following steps describe the whole process in a simple manner:

1. Install a new postgres database into a T3.micro EC2 instance

  * The very first step was 


2. Design and code a small scraping python app in vs code or similar
3. Use the app to scrape 200+ news articles and inspect the data. More data fields
(meta data, sentiment, etc) is better and more impressive.
4. Design the database table schema
5. Create the new database table and insert the news data
6. Analyse the news data in a jupyter notebook
7. Summarise and send details back to us so we can read your code, sql & db schema.
